Game circle life



it's all about a rocket ship.
we will Give it some force to move in a particular direction.
We've got to avoid bumping into the walls and obstacles and when we get to the end (Landing pad), We go to the next scene and load the new level.
So we're going to be dealing with loading of scenes or levels as we can call them.
The player (Rocket) will die when he failed to avoid bumping into the walls and obstacles.
and have to restart.

How to play



[W A S D] To control the rocket.
[L] To load a new level.
[C] Enable or Disable cheating mood.
[Q] Quit the game.

NOTE!

The cheat mood means that you can reach the landing pad even if you hit the obstacles.
One click to start and one click to stop mood.
